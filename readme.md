This is a simple DNN solution for basic multiclass classification tasks. It is trained on FashionMNIST dataset, and can correctly classify the objects in the dataset with around 89.3% accuracy.

To run the program, one can either run the jupyter notebook or classifier.py included here. When classifier.py is run, training begins automatically. It will then prompts the user for 28x28 pixels jpegs of FashionMNIST images. The model will then output its prediction of the class of the image.
